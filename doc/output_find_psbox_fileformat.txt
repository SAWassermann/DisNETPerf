The output file of the script find_psbox.py contains information about the target-IPs and the corresponding computed
closest boxes. The naming scheme of such an output-file is '<timestamp>_psbox.txt' where timestamps refers to the timestamp
indicating when the find_psbox.py was launched
The lines of an output-file follow the format:

<LABEL> <target-IP> <closest RIPE Atlas box ID> <closest RIPE Atlas box IP> <closest RIPE Atlas box AS> <minimum RTT>

<LABEL> can have the following values:
[OK]:       the candidate RIPE Atlas boxes (i.e. among the ones that the closest one has been chosen) are either in the same AS
            as <target-IP> or in the neighbour-ASes
[NO_AS]:    <target-IP> could not be mapped to an AS and thus the candidate RIPE Atlas boxes have been chosen randomly
[RANDOM]:   No candidate boxes have been found in the same AS as <target-IP> and in the neighbour-ASes. Boxes have thus
            been chosen randomly

<minimum RTT> refers to the minimum round-trip-time observed for selected box
